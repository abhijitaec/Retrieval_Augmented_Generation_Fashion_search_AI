# Retrieval Augmented Generation

## This project implements a Generative Search System that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to search through a large corpus of product descriptions and recommend relevant choices based on a user query. The system enhances traditional keyword-based search with semantic understanding and context-aware recommendations.

    - Python (Core Language)
    - ChromaDB (Vector Database for efficient retrieval)
    - Docker (Containerization for deployment)
